# The VSpace library

VSpace is a compact C++ library designed to allow processes in a
multi-process environment to interoperate via mmapped shared memory. The
library provides facilities for shared memory allocation and
deallocation, shared mutexes, semaphores, queues, lists, and hash
tables.

It takes its basic inspiration from the OCamlnet netmulticore library.
